## Creating a network diagram with the refrain of your favorite songs
<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmperafan/">Juan Manuel Perafan</a></p>

This function receives two arguments, the title of a song and the artist. Behind the scenes, this function uses the genius API. Therefore, it is imperative that the song and the artist match identically with the name it is written by genius. 

Based on lyrics of the song, the function will extract the refrain (sometimes known as hook or chorus) and visualize the parts that repeat themselves the most in a network diagram.
